# healthcare_staffing

This is a healthcare staffing Rust Smart Contract(Solana Blockchain).
It aims to provide foreign students and healthcare professionals with a comprehensive assessment of their academic records to facilitate their successful recruitment, training, and staffing in the US and other countries.

Below are some basic features contained in the program:

- Add applicant
- Add institution
- Submit application
- Approve applicant by institutions

## Getting started

In order to run this example program you will need to install Rust and
Solana. Information about installing Rust can be found
[here](https://rustup.rs/) and information about installing Solana can
be found [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).

Once you've completed the Solana installation run the following
commands to configure you machine for local development:

```
solana config set --url localhost
solana-keygen new
```

These two commands create Solana config files in `~/.config/solana/`
which solana command line tools will read in to determine what cluster
to connect to and what keypair to use.

Having done that run a local Solana validator by running:

```
solana-test-validator
```

This program must be left running in the background.

## Deploying the Solana program

To deploy the Solana program in this repository to the Solana cluster
that you have configured run:

```
anchor deploy
```

## Running the test program

To run the test program you must have already deployed the Solana
program. The test program sends a transaction to the Solana
blockchain asking it to execute the deployed program and reports the
results.

```
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```
